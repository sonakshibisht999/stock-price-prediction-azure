# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Azure AI

This project was developed as part of the *Microsoft Azure AI Internship* by *Edunet Foundation. It uses historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using regression models in **Azure Machine Learning Studio*.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Stock markets are influenced by many unpredictable factors, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions. This project aims to forecast stock prices using AI/ML to support better financial insights.

 ## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Linear Regression / Decision Forest Regression
- Yahoo Finance historical stock data (CSV)
- Power BI / Excel (for optional visualization)

## 📊 Dataset
- Sample company: Infosys (INFY.NS)
- Data includes: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

## 🧪 Model Workflow
1. Upload dataset to Azure ML
2. Clean & split data (80/20)
3. Apply regression model
4. Score & evaluate predictions
5. Visualize predicted vs actual prices

## 📈 Results
- *R² Score*: ~0.85
- *RMSE*: Low (accurate predictions)
- Output visual confirms strong trend capture

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Use LSTM/ARIMA for time series improvement
- Add sentiment analysis using Azure OpenAI
- Real-time Power BI dashboards
- Deploy as chatbot using Azure Bot Framework
